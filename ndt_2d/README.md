# sensors_lab3_2018
This repository contains a stub for a standard ROS package. The purpose of this stub is to be extended to a node that subscribes to laser scanner messages and performs post-processing of the data. The node is to be implemented as a part of the third lab in the sensors and sensing course at Orebro University.
